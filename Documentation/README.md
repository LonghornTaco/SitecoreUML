SitecoreUML is a productivity tool that enables architects to one-click deploy their Sitecore template architectures directly from their UML diagrams, as well as one-click import and generate UML diagrams from an existing Sitecore solution’s template architecture.

SitecoreUML can save countless project hours that would have been otherwise spent reproducing architectures diagrammed during planning phases. The round-trip diagram generation support means that any solution’s template architecture documentation can be updated at the click of a button, following every sprint, iteration, or milestone, and could even be updated automatically after every commit. It’s time to stop doing the same work twice, and spending hours on documentation, only to have it become outdated weeks, days or even just hours later. It’s time to start using SitecoreUML.

## Features

* One-click deploy Sitecore templates from UML directly to Sitecore
* One-click generate UML diagrams and models from a template architecture in Sitecore
* Seamless integration between the StarUML IDE and Sitecore XP 
* Save the URL of your Sitecore instance in your preferences so you don't have to enter it every time
* Built using a JavaScript-based platform that supports Node.js and can be easily extended and tailored to your needs
* And much more!

## Project Status

The SitecoreUML project is actively maintained, and new features are always under development. As a general rule, documentation for any new or existing feature will be updated within two days or one patch release of the associated code changes.

Feel free to reach out to me over Sitecore Slack \(@Zachary\_Kniebel\) to get involved and to provide feedback!

## Sprints & Milestones

The SitecoreUML project is run in 2-week sprints, with monthly milestones. A general goal of the project is to release at least one update per month, following the end of each milestone. This project is run following the agile methodology with continuous deployment, and updates are made available as soon as the tasks for the milestone are completed and validated. Occasionally, updates are released weeks early, but this is subject to schedule and availability.

Before every update, all work is reviewed, and any new or updated features are thoroughly tested and documented. Each release candidate is subsequently regression tested and undergoes an install, upgrade, and uninstall test, to avoid any issues for new or existing users. Any issues discovered or reported after a release are investigated and resolved as soon as possible, and fixes are immediately released as patch releases (e.g. version _X.X.3_, where the _3_ is the patch version). Patches are not held up for new features, other fixes, or milestone completion. 

As previously alluded to, each milestone is comprised of a set of tasks that must be completed for the update to be released. A high-level view of the tasks is available on the [Project Roadmap](/chapter1.md), which is updated regularly. The roadmap is meant to allow users to get an idea of which new features that are currently under development, which have already been completed and will be made available in the next update, and which were released in previous updates. Occasionally, tasks are added to or removed from milestones, based on the number of changes, relation of tasks to other tasks in the queue, etc. 

## Early Access to Features

As a general rule, I do not mark tasks as completed on the [Project Roadmap](/chapter1.md) until they are finished and developer-tested. If for any reason you need access to a feature that is marked complete but hasn't been released yet, feel free to reach out to me over Sitecore Slack (@zachary\_kniebel) and I will gladly create an _early access_ version for you. 

## About the Book

This book is meant to serve as a comprehensive guide to SitecoreUML, and is the primary source of the tool's documentation. In this book, you can find definitions and quick references, installation and configuration instructions, information regarding syntax and data models, feature and tool usage, details on how the tool can be extended and customized, as well as walkthroughs and tutorials.

## Contributors

My name is Zachary Kniebel, and I am the sole contributor to the SitecoreUML project, as well as the sole author of this book. Feel free to reach out to me any time over Sitecore Community Slack \(@zachary\_kniebel\) if you have any questions, issues, or comments regarding this tool. I am always happy to help.
