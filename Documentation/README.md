# SitecoreUML: An Accelerator for Solution Architects

SitecoreUML is a productivity tool that enables architects to one-click deploy their Sitecore template architectures directly from their UML diagrams, as well as one-click import and generate UML diagrams from an existing Sitecore solution’s template architecture.

SitecoreUML can save countless project hours that would have been otherwise spent reproducing architectures diagrammed during planning phases. The round-trip diagram generation support means that any solution’s template architecture documentation can be updated at the click of a button, following every sprint, iteration, or milestone, and could even be updated automatically after every commit. It’s time to stop doing the same work twice, and spending hours on documentation, only to have it become outdated weeks, days or even just hours later. It’s time to start using SitecoreUML.

## Features

* One-click deploy Sitecore templates from UML directly to Sitecore
* One-click generate UML diagrams and models from a template architecture in Sitecore
* Seamless integration between the StarUML IDE and Sitecore XP 
* Save the URL of your Sitecore instance in your preferences so you don't have to enter it every time
* Built using a JavaScript-based platform that supports Node.js and can be easily extended and tailored to your needs
* And much more!

## Project Status

The SitecoreUML project is currently under development and the current version is [_alpha_](https://github.com/zkniebel/SitecoreUML/releases)\_. \_An "alpha" version is typically a pre-release version that indicates that the software has been tested during feature development, but developer-level testing has not been formally completed. At present, the only outstanding task that I am requiring completion on before moving to "beta" is the documentation build-out. I plan to have enough documentation in this book for a user to start working with the software before I open it up to beta testers.

## About the Book

This book should serve as the primary reference for all of your SitecoreUML documentation needs. In this book, you can find definitions and quick references, installation and configuration instructions, information regarding syntax and data models, feature/tool usage, details on how the tool can be extended and customized, as well as walkthroughs and tutorials.

_**Currently, this book is under construction, and content will be added in as quickly as possible. Please know that unlike most developers I know, I actually don't mind writing documentation. **I will do everything in my power to get this book populated with content as quickly as I can. _
