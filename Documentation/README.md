SitecoreUML is a productivity tool that enables architects to one-click deploy their Sitecore template architectures directly from their UML diagrams, as well as one-click import and generate UML diagrams from an existing Sitecore solution’s template architecture.

SitecoreUML can save countless project hours that would have been otherwise spent reproducing architectures diagrammed during planning phases. The round-trip diagram generation support means that any solution’s template architecture documentation can be updated at the click of a button, following every sprint, iteration, or milestone, and could even be updated automatically after every commit. It’s time to stop doing the same work twice, and spending hours on documentation, only to have it become outdated weeks, days or even just hours later. It’s time to start using SitecoreUML.

## Features

* One-click deploy Sitecore templates from UML directly to Sitecore
* One-click generate UML diagrams and models from a template architecture in Sitecore
* Seamless integration between the StarUML IDE and Sitecore XP 
* Save the URL of your Sitecore instance in your preferences so you don't have to enter it every time
* Built using a JavaScript-based platform that supports Node.js and can be easily extended and tailored to your needs
* And much more!
