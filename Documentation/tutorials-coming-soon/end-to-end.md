# Tutorials

Tutorials will be made available as soon as possible. In the meantime, you can use the [Guide](/guide/the-staruml-ide.md) as a tutorial. 

## Using the Guide as a Tutorial

The guide essentially an extended tutorial with each chapter using new examples instead of sharing a continuous one. However, the guide is meant to take you through the entire SitecoreUML experience, from opening the IDE for the first time, to creating architectures from scratch to eventually deploying those architectures to Sitecore.

If you are looking for a tutorial, try following along with the guide and just skip the concepts and explanations. Action sections, like "Create a Project" or "Add an Inheriting Template" will stand out on their own and be brief, with explicit instructions for performing the action. 

## Issues or Questions

Let me know if you have any issues or questions. Feel free to reach out to me anytime over Sitecore Slack \(@zachary\_kniebel\).
