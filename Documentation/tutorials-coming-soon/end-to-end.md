# Tutorials

Tutorials will be made available as soon as possible. In the meantime, follow along with the guide and read through each chapter, in order. 

The guide is meant to to take you through the entire SitecoreUML experience, from opening the IDE for the first time, to creating architectures from scratch to eventually deploying those architectures to Sitecore.

Let me know if you have any issues or questions. Feel free to reach out to me anytime over Sitecore Slack \(@zachary\_kniebel\).
