# Deploy and Import

The real bread and butter of SitecoreUML is its ability to do the following:

* One-click deploy template architectures directly from UML diagrams to Sitecore, as actual template items with fields, folders and all
* One-click import and generate UML architecture diagrams directly from the templates of existing Sitecore instances

This chapter shows you just how easy it is to execute the _deploy_ and _import_ actions.

## Deploy

Go to _Sitecore_ &gt; _Deploy Templates to Sitecore_

Done.

## Import and Generate

Go to _Sitecore_ &gt; _Import Templates from Sitecore_

Done.
