# Template Inheritance

Sitecore's template inheritance is a powerful feature, but not the most visible when looking at Sitecore. It can be tedious to record inheritance when creating a template architecture, so being able to visualize these relationships is one of SitecoreUML's most powerful features.

## Adding an Inheriting Template

Creating a template that inherits another is similar to [Adding a Template Sub-Folder](/adding-a-template-sub-folder). In UML, the concept of a "Sub-Interface" exists, but it isn't a single element. Rather, a sub-interface is a combination of an _Interface_ and a _Generalization_.

For those new to UML, a Generalization is essentially a type of relationship that shows one interface inheriting \(or generalizing\) another. UML uses the term "generalization" to differentiate between an interface inheriting another and an element \(e.g. class\) that _implements_ \(or "realizes", as it's referred to in UML\) an interface.

As with adding child template folders, there are essentially two ways to add an inheriting interface, in StarUML: the _easy method_, and the _manual method_.

### The Easy Method

Adding an inheriting template the easy way avoids having to manually create the Generalization yourself. To add an inheriting template the easy way, perform the following steps:

1. Double-click on the base template for which you want to add a new inheriting template ![](/assets/StarUML-Interfaces-InheritanceAdd.png)
2. In the set of buttons to the right of the template name, click the bottom-leftmost button, which looks like a circle with an arrow coming out of the top \(![](/assets/StarUML-Interfaces-InheritanceAdd-Button.png)\)
3. Rename the inheriting template by double-clicking and replacing the text with the desired name
