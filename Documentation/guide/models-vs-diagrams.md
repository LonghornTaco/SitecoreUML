# Tree Hierarchy



This chapter has been split into two parts: [Concepts](/guide/models-vs-diagrams/concepts.md) and [Manipulating Hierarchies](/guide/models-vs-diagrams/manipulating.md).

## For UML Novices

Before you proceed to [Manipulating Hierarchies](/guide/models-vs-diagrams/manipulating.md), please spend an extra few minutes going through the [Concepts](/guide/models-vs-diagrams/concepts.md) chapter and try out the two experiments that I demonstrate, for yourself. Really make sure that you understand the concepts before proceeding, as they could save you from making some hard-to-detect mistakes.

## For UML Experts New to StarUML

Please spend an extra few minutes reading the [Models vs Diagrams](/guide/models-vs-diagrams/concepts.md#models-vs-diagrams) section of the [Concepts](/guide/models-vs-diagrams/concepts.md) chapter. It is vital for you to understand the described nuances of StarUML before continuing.

## For StarUML Experts

Feel free to take a few minutes to review the [Concepts](/Concepts) chapter and refresh your memory. Try to poke holes in my examples and proofs and send feedback to @zachary\_kniebel over Sitecore Slack. I'd love to get your thoughts and incorporate them into this documentation.
