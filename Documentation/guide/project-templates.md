# Project Templates

Project Templates are included in **Version 1.0+** and provide a shortcut for creating new SitecoreUML projects. As was mentioned in the [Projects](/guide/creating-a-project.md) and [Diagrams](/guide/diagrams.md) chapters, SitecoreUML projects typically consist of one or more Diagram Sets. SitecoreUML includes project templates that enable you to create a new project with a Diagram Set, by default.

## Creating a New Project from a Project Template

To create a new project from one of the SitecoreUML project templates, perform the following steps:

1. Go to _File_ &gt; _New From Template_ &gt; _Sitecore_
2. Select the template that you would like to create your new project from. Descriptions of each of the native SitecoreUML project templates can be found below, in the [Included Project Templates](#included-project-templates) section.

## Included Project Templates

SitecoreUML includes the following project templates:

| **Name** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- |
| Blank Project | Creates a new project with a blank Diagram Set |
| Helix Project | Creates a new project with a Diagram Set that includes a _Foundation_, _Feature_, and _Project_ template folder, saving you from having to model the base Helix structure on your own |
