# Project Templates

Project Templates are included in **Version 1.0+** and provide a shortcut for creating new SitecoreUML projects. As was mentioned in the [Projects](/guide/creating-a-project.md) and [Diagrams](/guide/diagrams.md) chapters, SitecoreUML projects typically consist of one or more Diagram Sets. SitecoreUML includes project templates that enable you to create a new project with a Diagram Set, by default.
