# The StarUML IDE

As a large portion of SItecoreUML's functionality is based on creating an architectural diagram and model in the StarUML, we must first understand the interface in which we will be working. When creating and editing UML diagrams and models within StarUML, the majority of your time will be spent working with the following three components of the interface:

1. On the left, we have our “Toolbox”, from which we choose what elements we wish to add to our diagrams. 
2. In the center, we have our diagram window, where we can edit our diagrams. 
3. On the right, we have our “Model Explorer”, where we can view the different pieces that make up our modeling project, as well as the hierarchy in which they live.
