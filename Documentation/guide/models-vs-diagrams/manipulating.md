# Manipulating Hierarchies

It is important to note that the tree hierarchy visible in the Model Explorer at any given time is an exact match to what the resulting template hierarchy would be in Sitecore if SitecoreUML was used to deploy the templates at that moment. This chapter discusses the two very simple ways to manipulate your tree hierarchies, as well as the more complex theory and logic behind them.

_As was mentioned in the Diagrams chapter, SitecoreUML recommends but does not require that you split your templates and your template folders into separate Templates Diagrams and Template Folders Diagrams. Up until this point, the guide has assumed that you have been following SitecoreUML's recommendations, but this chapter will cover both approaches._
