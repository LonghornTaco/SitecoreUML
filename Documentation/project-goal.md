# Goals of SitecoreUML

The goal of this project is simple: make solution architecture with Sitecore _easier_, more _visible_, and _faster_.

Solution Architecture is not easy. That's not to say that architecture tasks don't begin to come naturally after repetition and practice. Rather, it is to say that a lot of different things go into being an architect that extend beyond the realm of development.

On a given project, a solution architect may be responsible for pre-sales, sales, planning and estimations, SOW and contract preparation, initial architecture and proof of concept, leadership and oversight over other teams teams \(e.g. DevOps, design, UX, etc.\), ... that's all before development starts, and its only a fraction of what a solution architect may be responsible for.

In my opinion and experience, the hardest part of being a solution architect isn't any of the things that are mentioned above. Rather, the hardest part is doing all of those things and then documenting and relaying their outcomes in a timely fashion, before the implementation teams get started. 

Thinking critically on this challenge, one can divide it into two major needs that must be satisfied in order to succeed:

* Visibility into what has been done and what the implementation teams have to work with \(e.g. documentation\)
* Faster execution of the tasks so more time can be spent on knowledge management

If we can address these these needs then our jobs as solution architects will inherently be easier. 

SitecoreUML seeks to address these challenges by accelerating the speed at which an architect can devise, document and implement their Sitecore template architecture.
