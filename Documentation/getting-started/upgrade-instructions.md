# Upgrade Instructions

This page provides instructions for upgrading SitecoreUML.

## Typical Upgrades

Most SitecoreUML versions can be upgraded by following the typical [Installation and Setup](/getting-started/setup-and-insta.md) instructions for the new version. There is no need to uninstall the existing version, first.

## Skipping Versions

Unlike with Sitecore upgrades, SitecoreUML _does not_ require that you follow an upgrade path or upgrade to each successive version leading up to the targeted version. Feel free to skip versions, at will. This page will list out version-specific upgrade instructions for any artifact Sitecore items that must be removed when upgrading to later versions. As such, be sure to review this page before performing your upgrade.

## Version-Specific Instructions

Some versions may require additional pre-installation or post-installation steps, e.g. removing artifact Sitecore items from the previous installation. Upgrade instructions for versions with additional steps will be listed, below:
