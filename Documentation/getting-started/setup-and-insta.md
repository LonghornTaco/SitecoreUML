# Setup and Installation

1a. Install the Sitecore Package for the appropriate version from the 

    .\Installation\SitecorePackage\ folder into your Sitecore instance

1b. Note that it is recommended that you do NOT install the Sitecore package

    on a Content Delivery \(CD\) instance. However, if you choose to do so, 

    please delete or disable the included Sitecore patch config at the path

    "App\_Config/Include/SitecoreUML/SitecoreUML.CM.config" from your CD 

    instance.

2a. Install StarUML \(http://staruml.io/\)

2b. Note that an evaluation \(trial\) of StarUML can be used at any time without

    expiring and have all of the same features as an unlocked version. StarUML 

    does request that you purchase a license, if intending to use the software 

    continuously. Again, evaluation licenses do not expire and have all of the 

    same features as the licensed version, so feel free to try the software 

    out and make your own decision on the licensing, based on how you plan to

    use it.

3.  Copy the .\Installation\StarUMLExtension\SitecoreUML folder \(not just its 

	contents\) to your "%APPDATA%\StarUML\extensions\user" folder.

4.  Launch StarUML

5.  Go to File &gt; Preferences &gt; Sitecore and provide the URL of the Sitecore

    instance that you want to connect to. Preferences save automatically, so

    just close the Preferences dialog when you're done. 

    

Once you have completed the above steps, you will be ready to start using 

SitecoreUML! Have fun and stay tuned for future updates!
