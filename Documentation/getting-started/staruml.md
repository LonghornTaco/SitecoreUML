# StarUML

StarUML is one of the most popular modeling and diagramming tools on the market. It is important to know that StarUML is not just a diagramming tool, like Microsoft Visio, but also a modeling tool, wherein the model can be represented beyond the scope of the diagrams, alone. In other words, a diagram is a model but a model is not a diagram. Conceptually speaking, a diagram is a type of visual model. SitecoreUML leverages both the diagramming and modeling aspects of StarUML.
