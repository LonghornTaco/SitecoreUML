# SitecoreUML (alpha-r0)

SitecoreUML is a productivity tool that enables architects to create Sitecore templates directly from their UML diagrams, as well as export an existing Sitecore solution’s template architecture and generate UML diagrams from it. 

SitecoreUML can save countless project hours spent reproducing architectures diagrammed during planning phases. The round-trip diagram generation support also means that any solution’s template architecture documentation can be updated at the click of a button, following every sprint, iteration, or milestone, and could even be updated automatically after every commit. It’s time to stop doing the same work twice, and spending hours on documentation, only to have it become outdated weeks, days or even just hours later. It’s time to start using SitecoreUML.

## Features

 - One-click export of Sitecore templates as JSON
 - Generate robust, detailed Sitecore template architecture diagrams from an existing solution
 - Plan your template architecture by diagramming in StarUML and import the result into Sitecore as templates
 - And more!

## How it Works

SitecoreUML creates an integration between Sitecore and StarUML, a feature-rich and highly customizable UML modeling and diagramming tool. SitecoreUML includes both a Sitecore module and a StarUML extension that together enable the serialization and deserialization of template data into and out of both Sitecore and StarUML. 

## Project Status

The project is currently under development, and the current version is *alpha-r0* (the first pre-release before the official alpha release). The code that is currently in the project works, but requires some cleanup and reorganization, as the *alpha-r0* release was essentially two different POCs spliced together. Right now, the tool is a little light on features, but more will be added shortly. 

## Contributors

Currently, I am the only contributor to this project, but I am hoping to open source it in the coming months. If you are interested in teaming up, send me a message over Sitecore Slack (@zachary_kniebel).
