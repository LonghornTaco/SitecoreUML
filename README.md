# SitecoreUML (alpha-r3)

SitecoreUML is a productivity tool that enables architects to create Sitecore templates directly from their UML diagrams, as well as export an existing Sitecore solution’s template architecture and generate UML diagrams from it. 

SitecoreUML can save countless project hours spent reproducing architectures diagrammed during planning phases. The round-trip diagram generation support also means that any solution’s template architecture documentation can be updated at the click of a button, following every sprint, iteration, or milestone, and could even be updated automatically after every commit. It’s time to stop doing the same work twice, and spending hours on documentation, only to have it become outdated weeks, days or even just hours later. It’s time to start using SitecoreUML.

## Features

 - One-click deploy Sitecore templates from UML to Sitecore
 - One-click generate UML models and diagrams from Sitecore template architecture
 - One-click import or export templates from Sitecore or from StarUML as JSON data
 - Generate robust, detailed Sitecore template architecture diagrams from an existing solution
 - Plan your template architecture by diagramming in StarUML and import the result into Sitecore as templates
 - And more!

## How it Works

SitecoreUML creates an integration between Sitecore and StarUML, a feature-rich and highly customizable UML modeling and diagramming tool. SitecoreUML includes both a Sitecore module and a StarUML extension that together enable the serialization, deserialization and transmission of template data between the two systems. 

## Project Status

The project is currently under development, and the current version is *alpha-r3* (pre-release 3 before the official alpha release). The code that is currently in the project works and has been tested end-to-end for all expected scenarios during feature development. However, developer-level testing has not yet been formally conducted. 

At present, the tool will create templates and fields with matching sort order, field type and name, and the same information will be brought into the generated UML diagrams. Additional features will be coming soon, so stay tuned!

## Upcoming Features
 
### Version 1.1 (December 2017)

 - Support for "Title" field of template fields
 - Support for "Source" field of template fields
 - Support for "Display Name" field of items

### Version 2.0 (Coming in 2018)

 - Azure infrastructure provisioning support
 - AWS infrastructure provisioning support
 - and more
