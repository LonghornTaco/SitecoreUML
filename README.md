SitecoreUML is a productivity tool that enables architects to create Sitecore templates directly from their UML diagrams, as well as export an existing Sitecore solution’s template architecture and generate UML diagrams from it.

SitecoreUML can save countless project hours spent reproducing architectures diagrammed during planning phases. The round-trip diagram generation support also means that any solution’s template architecture documentation can be updated at the click of a button, following every sprint, iteration, or milestone, and could even be updated automatically after every commit. It’s time to stop doing the same work twice, and spending hours on documentation, only to have it become outdated weeks, days or even just hours later. It’s time to start using SitecoreUML.

Check out the video demo, below and see the [documentation](https://zkniebel.gitbooks.io/sitecoreuml/) for more!

## Features

* One-click deploy Sitecore templates from UML directly to Sitecore
* One-click generate UML diagrams and models from a template architecture in Sitecore
* Seamless integration between the StarUML IDE and Sitecore XP
* Save the URL of your Sitecore instance in your preferences so you don't have to enter it every time
* Built using a JavaScript-based platform that supports Node.js and can be easily extended and tailored to your needs
* And much more!

## How it Works

SitecoreUML creates an integration between Sitecore and StarUML, a feature-rich and highly customizable UML modeling and diagramming tool. SitecoreUML includes both a Sitecore module and a StarUML extension that together enable the serialization, deserialization and transmission of template data between the two systems. Check out the [documentation](https://zkniebel.gitbooks.io/sitecoreuml/) for more details!

## Project Status

The SitecoreUML project is actively maintained, and new features are always under development. As a general rule, documentation for any new or existing feature will be updated within two days or one patch release of the associated code changes.
